I developed a path finding solution for the driverless car from scratch. I created an offline map/network by using Google maps to analyze the connections between the major cities in the greater Vancouver area and
lower mainland. We assume the car loses its real-time GPS data and need to rely only on an off-line map. I calculated the costs and heuristic functions and then implemented three graph-based path planning algorithms i.e Grassfire, A*, and Dijkstra algorithm.
